				<h3>Development Overview</h3>
			
				<p>
					In this project, I worked on a multidisciplinary team comprising of artists, programmers, designers, and producer. To develop this game, 
					we worked using the SCRUM methodology and completed our game by delivering milestones to our stakeholder. These milestones were:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b><u>Initial Prototype</u></b> – where we presented a series of prototypes to our stakeholders to pitch and sell the idea of the game.</li><br><br>
					
					<li><b><u>PoCT</u></b> (Proof of Concept Technology) - The PoCT demonstrably proves that key technologies—including the game engine, subsystems, pipelines, and tools—are all sufficiently 
					developed to support the development of the game’s core gameplay mechanics, loops, and pillars.</li><br><br>
											
					<li><b><u>PoCG</u></b> (Proof of Concept Gameplay) – The PoCG demonstrably proves the core gameplay loop, core mechanics, loops, and pillars are fun to play and achievable to build.</li><br><br>
					
					<li><b><u>1st Playable</u></b> – The 1st Playable milestone is the first version of the game that is playable beginning to end with all major gameplay elements and loops in place. 
					Within a slice of the milestone, it also includes defined sets of assets that are representative of the defined, shippable quality of the game.</li><br><br>
					
					<li><b><u>Alpha</u></b> – Alpha delivers the entire game for the first time. It must be arguably shippable, contain no placeholder assets, and, critically, be feature-complete. 
					From this point forward, production shifts to polishing the game to professional quality standards, balancing gameplay, and fixing bugs.</li><br><br>
					
					<li><b><u>Beta</u></b> –  The game is complete and shippable at Beta. All assets are locked and final, regardless of quality. Only showstopping bugs will be fixed beyond this point. 
					Production shifts to lock-down mode where only negotiated, surgical fixes are made beyond this point. </li><br><br>
					
					<li><b><u>RTM</u></b> (Release to Manufacturer) – where we submit our “Gold Master” as a release candidate and prepare marketing materials, media, archived your assets.</li>
				</ul>

			<h3>My Contributions</h3>
					
					<div class="midLeftColumn">
					<h4>1) Design Base Metrics for Environment Design</h4>
						<p>
							I contributed in designing and establishing the base metrics for designing and building the environment based on the movement 
							system that we had for the frog (protagonist character). To do so, I made a prototype level that showcased these measurements so that everyone in the team could have 
							a reference to look back when designing levels and features. 
						</p>

				</ul>

					<h4>2) Design and Build one of the Initial Side Chambers of the Temple</h4>
					<p>
						One of my contributions to the project was to design and build one of the initial side chambers of the temple (named “Act 0”). This is where the player is first introduced 
						to one of the puzzle elements in the games: the sliding blocks that players squirt to make them slide along a predetermined path.
					</p>
					<h5>Design Goals</h5>
						<p>
							This section of the temple was designed with the following goals in mind: 
						</p>
					<ul>
						<li>To serve as an introductory scene to the sliding blocks</li>
						<li>To implicitly teach the player how the sliding blocks work while still making a puzzle out of it</li>
						<li>Maintain a temple-like architecture that was consistent with the game designer's vision of the game</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>3) Environment Decoration</h4>
					<p>
						Once we built the playable spaces of the temple, I assisted the artists in decorating some of the areas of the temple based on concept art and level paintovers made
						by the artists on the team.
					</p>

				<div class="midLeftColumn">
					<h4>4) Feature Implementation - Glowing Trail</h4>
					<p>
						One of my responsibilities of this project was to develop a feature we called the “glowing trail” feature, which is a feature made to show a visual connection between paired 
						sliding blocks; whenever the player activated a paired block by squirting at either one of the paired blocks, a line linking the pair will glow sequentially from start to end.
						Once I implemented this feature, I made documentation available to the team to show how it worked and how to use it so that everyone in the team could understand how to use it and	
						artist could take the feature to replace the placeholder assets with final assets.

					<h4>5) Marketing Material - Trailer</h4>
					<p>
						During the later stages of development, I worked closely with the sound designer, to design and make the trailer for La Rana. My primary responsibilities were to capture all the cinematics and 
						gameplay footages needed with Unreal Engine's camera sequences to compose the trailer and present my progress to the game designer, lead artist, and stakeholders. This trailer is currently
						being used to market the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/934860/La_Rana/Steam" target="_blank">Steam</a>
