<h1>Unreal Tournament 4 CTF Map: Egocentric Empanadas</h1>

Egocentric Empanadas is a Capture the Flag (CTF) multiplayer map 
developed for Unreal Tournament 4 where two opposing teams fight 
against each other to capture the other team’s flag to return it 
to their base to score points. This is a map designed for 8 players 
(4 players per team) with a focus on fast-pace gameplay. 

This is an open space arena floating in space with almost no enclosed rooms. 
Its overall shape is lineal so that the bases are at 
opposite ends of the map and are directly facing each other.This map 
also makes extensive use of jump pads with long trajectories for players 
to quickly fly around the map while dodging enemies and engaging in mid-air combat.

<h2>Development Overview</h2>

This is a project from one of my level design classes that I took at SMU Guildhall, and for this project, I decided
that I wanted to create a level with unique features and style that
would make the gameplay unique and enjoyable. Given that many players
enjoy fast and exciting gameplay and that Unreal Tournament 4 gives the player some 
interesting movement abilities, I decided that I wanted to design a level with these ideas
in mind and experiment with a design that would also make extensive use of mid-air
combat, which has shown potential for being fun in previous games.

I started out designing this level by doing sketches to figure out the overall shape of the level
and laying down the main components of a CTF map, such as the team bases, outer base, and midground as 
well as planning the distribution of resources, such as weapons, health and armor pickups. After drafting
a promising design, I proceeded to prototype the level in Unreal Tournament Editor using BSP brushes 
to quickly block out the gameplay space of the level and leaving the aesthetics details for later. Once I had 
a playable level with all the promised features, I then started to iterate and refine the level gameplay 
after playtesting with other players and gathering their feedback.

Once I had a solid gameplay layed out in my map, I then started to work on the aesthetics of the level;
I begun to replace the BSP brushes with static meshes and work on the lighting to make the level more
aesthetically pleasant and refine its look to achieve its current state 

<h2> About The Map's Name </h2>

The name of this map emerged from the original shape that the outer base area had 
during the gameplay design stage; the outer base consisted of two semi-circular platforms
that resemble the shape of empanadas, and because these empanada-shaped platforms were
surrounding the bases and keeping these for themselves, they were deemed egocentric. 

During the development of the level aesthetics, replicating the shape of these platforms 
with static meshes without making it look weird was a hard thing to do, and because we
were not allowed to use custom mesh models to construct our maps, I decided to simplify
the shape of the outer base area to make it easier to construct with the given modular
pieces and achieve a more polished-looking look for these platforms.Egocentric Empanadas was 
in fact the working name for this map, and because it was a catchy, fun, and unique 
name that was well liked among my peers, I decided to keep it and make it part of the 
gimmick of the level: Egocentric Empanadas!
