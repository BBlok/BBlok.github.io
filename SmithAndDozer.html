				<h2>Smith And Dozer</h2>
				<div class="midLeftColumn">
		
					<p>
						Smith & Dozer is a 2D action-platformer for Android tablets. Set on an abandoned planet in the farthest reaches of the galaxy, 
						a pair of intergalactic treasure hunters named Smith and Dozer search the ruins of an old civilization for lost riches. 
						The pair must shoot and smash their way through the robot dinosaurs that have taken control of the city. Players navigate 
						through ruins and caves to collect gems while fighting off the aggressive race of synthetic dinosaurs. Being a dynamic pair, 
						the player can choose to switch between controlling Smith and Dozer at any time to take advantage of each of their strengths. 
						Smith can jump higher and farther with his jetpack and shoot at enemies from a distance with his dual blaster pistols. 
						Dozer can take more damage thanks to his thick armor and smash through the robot dinosaurs with his sledgehammer. 
						Players must constantly swap between the two to face whatever challenge is presented to them. The game features five levels 
						with achievements and high scores in each to encourage repeated plays through the game.

				<h3>Development Overview</h3>
					<p>
						In this project, I worked on a multidisciplinary team of four developers at SMU Guildhall. To develop this game, 
						we worked using the SCRUM methodology and completed our game by delivering milestones to our stakeholder. These milestones were:
					</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li><b><u>Vertical Slice</u></b> – where we delivered a fully playable and complete level of the game with most of the features promised for the game </li>
						<li><b><u>Alpha</u></b> – where we delivered the game with all the assets and features promised</li>
						<li><b><u>Beta</u></b> – where we delivered a more refined version of the game</li>
						<li><b><u>Launch</u></b> – where we delivered gold master – the finished build of the game along with a physical copy of the game and all the marketing materials, such as video trailers and poster </li>
					</ul>
			</div>
			
			<div class="pageSection">
			
				<h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>I designed and implemented level 3 and level 5 of the game.</li>
						<li>I worked closely in the design and implementation of the user interface, including controller layout and menus.</li>
						<li>I worked in the design of the game, such as defining the player’s core loops, balancing the player characters and the enemies, and the core gameplay and mechanics of the game.</li> 
					</ul>
			
			
				<h3>Design Pillars</h3>
				<p>
					The design and development of this game was made under three fundamental design pillars:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><b><u>Approachable</u></b> - All mechanics and controls should be intuitive and easy. Keep interactions simple, don't hide information from the player. The theme of the game should be fun and child friendly.</li>
					<li><b><u>Action oriented platforming</u></b> - Levels should be filled with enemies. Controls should feel good and not be frustrating in combat.</li>
					<li><b><u>Lots of juice!</u></b> - The game should have plenty of satisfying visual feedback, including particle effects, enemies exploding into gibs, subtle screen shake, knockback, conveyance, compelling art
						and sound effects.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h3>Level Design Walkthrough</h3>
				
				<h4>Level 3 - Cave</h4>
				<div class="midLeftColumn">
				<p>
					In this level, Smith and Dozer find an abandoned hidden cave during dusk. It is an entrance to
					the secret base, and it is mostly made with earth-like rocks and soil with some vegetation scattered
					around such as plants and vines. The level layout is set so that the player starts from the top
					entrance of a cave and goes its way to the bottom right the level where the player encounters the
					outer area of the secret base.

				</p>
					
				<p>
					The level begins with a small indirect puzzle that allows the player to choose either Smith or Dozer and the best 
					moment to drop off from the initial platform. If the player asserts, he/she will be able to land the character and 
					attack the patrolling enemies without taking damage. Afterwards, the player finds a trail of gems which serves as 
					a reward and as a guide for the player to follow to continue exploring the level. The rest of the level contains 
					similar encounters with patrolling melee enemies as well as with stationary ranged enemies guarding the way towards 
					the exit. Some of these enemies also guard other valuable items, such as health pickups and gems.
				</p>
					
				<p>
					At the top of the level there is an enclosed room located at the top which contains five weak melee characters packed together. 
					Since this room requires the player to use Dozer to break the doors, it gives the opportunity for the player to discover that Dozer 
					is effective for ramming through weak melee characters as well as figuring out that Dozer can take more damage than Smith.
				</p>

				<h4>Level 5 - The Final Treasure</h4>
				<a href="images/S&D/Level5.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/S&D/Level5.png" alt="Level 5 overview" width="100%" style="padding: 3% 0;"></a>
				
				<p>
					This is the last level of the game. It is the hardest and the longest level among all 5 levels as it requires mastery of all the skills 
					that the player has learned through the previous levels, such as double jumping, shooting, and engaging in melee combat. It features plenty 
					of platforms and buildings for the player to jump around; it has the most number of enemies of all level, and it features plenty of traps 
					such as death pits and ceiling spikes, thus making it the most dangerous level of the game.
				</p>
			</div>	
			
			<div class="pageSection">
				<h4>Level 5 - Part 1</h4>
				<div class="midLeftColumn">
				<p>
					The player begins enclosed in a room close to a tough melee enemy patrolling the area nearby, which takes two heavy hammer strikes to eliminate. 
					The entrance door gives initial protection to the player as well as giving the player a chance to prepare and choose when to break in. 
					As the player walks towards the right, a trap is triggered, and 4 enemies drop down from above and walk down towards the player’s location 
					to attack the player. After defeating these enemies, the player proceeds to continue his way out by jumping a series of platforms and dodging/attacking 
					the enemies shooting from above.

				<h4>Level 5 - Part 2</h4>
				<div class="midLeftColumn">
				<p>
					This part of the level challenges the player’s ability to time his/her jumps with Smith to jump across several rooftops. 
					Going from left to right, the first building provides an extra platform attached to its left to make an easy jump with Smith. 
					This allows the player to cool off a bit from the battling from the beginning of the level as well as to give him/her a bit of confidence. 
					The following rooftops then start to become more difficult: they require the player to perform double jumps and follow the implicit lines 
					formed by the yellow floating gems to collect them, which requires a careful timing for pressing the forward and jump button. Furthermore, 
					some of the rooftops have enemies shooting and patrolling the area, which adds an extra layer of difficulty to these challenges.

				<h4>Level 5 - Part 3</h4>
				<div class="midLeftColumn">
				<p>
					This part of the level is the most guarded area of the level. It contains several range and melee enemies protecting the area from outsiders, 
					and it encourages the player to combine both characters’ abilities. The middle area of the level gives serves as a choke point that requires 
					the player to maneuver carefully to avoid the ceiling spikes as well as to attack enemies nearby, and the area to the right contain several 
					ranged enemies that the player needs to battle to collect the final treasure chest.

				<h3>Postmortem</h3>
				<h4>What Went Well</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>I delivered all the work that I promised to deliver.</li>
					<li>I was very active in the discussion of ideas for the development of the game.</li>
					<li>After some trial and error, I managed to do version control with perforce effectively.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>What Went Wrong</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>I was not very organized with documentation and oftentimes did not update the game design document as I worked on the game.</li>
					<li>I did not keep track of the decision log, so it was hard to recall when certain decisions in the development of the game were made.</li>
					<li>Part of my development process was inefficient. Just because there is a way of doing something doesn't mean that that is the best way of doing it</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>What I Learned</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>I should document all my work as I develop instead of leaving it for later.</li>
					<li>Communication is key to shipping games.</li>
					<li>Learned to speak up when something wasn't working out, especially during the earlier stages of development.</li>
				</ul>
