				<h3>Quest Overview</h3>
			
				<p>
					An Emerging Plague is a single player standalone quest mod made for Fallout 4. In this quest, a small improvised criminal organization known as the Capybaras 
					has emerged during the post-war era and have been seizing settlements near Sanctuary Hills to gain territory, resources, and power. A villager named Greg from one of 
					these affected settlements has discovered the location of the Capybaras’ lair (an abandoned prison) and visited Sanctuary Hills to seek help from the player. Greg 
					approaches the player and asks him/her to go to the Capybaras’ lair to kill their leaders in hopes of dissolving their criminal organization. 
					Once the player arrives to the Capybaras’ lair, (s)he stumbles upon a prisoner named Leo, who was captured by the criminal organization. Leo begs the player for help 
					and tells the player where the leaders of the Capybara are and that they are about to go out on their next trip to seize another settlement. Leo also begs the player to 
					rescue him and his wife Matilda, who is being tortured to death somewhere nearby and is about to die . The player relates his/her story with the prisoner’s situation and 
					is willing to help. However, Matilda and the leaders of the Capybaras are on opposite ends of the facility, and there is not enough time to kill the leaders of the 
					Capybaras and rescue Matilda, so the player must decide whether to rescue Matilda or kill the leaders of the Capybaras before they go on their next raid and kill more villagers.
