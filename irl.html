				<div class="midLeftColumn">
		
					<p>
						Interstellar racing league (IRL) is a couch-competitive multiplayer futuristic racing game where 
						players race against each other along gravity-defying tracks to compete for of the Galaxy’s Best Racer. 
						The game features 4 unique racers, each with distinctive vehicle specs suited for different playstyles, and
						and powerups that racers can use to gain an edge against each other and win the race.

				<h3>Development Overview</h3>
			
			
			<div class="midLeftColumn">
				
					<p>
						To develop this game, our team broke into sub-teams to work on various aspects of the game, including car physics, track design 
						(where I worked most of the time), environment, and audio design. Each sub-team worked using the SCRUM methodology and followed 
						established pipelines in order to work efficiently.
					</p>
					
					
					<h3>Roles and Responsibilities</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>I designed and developed one of the tracks (playable area) for the game- The Fallen City track along with pertinent documentation.</li>
						<li>I assisted in developing and testing the other tracks of the game (mostly the Downtown and District-38 tracks).</li>
						<li>I worked in prototyping the environment (non-playable space) for the District-38 track during early stages of development.</li> 
						<li>Maintain a close communication with my sub-team and leads.</li>
						<li>Coordinate with the environment team for the development of the Fallen City track</li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Designer Writeup</h3>
					<p>
						As a designer in 60-Strong Studios, one of my most relevant works included the development of the Fallen City track.  The Fallen City 
						(formerly known as the Oasis) takes place in a planet with a similar ecosystem to the one found in Earth. This track is designed to be the 
						most condensed track of the game, and it features plenty of sharp turns to encourage player interaction. Overall, this track takes approximately 
						40 seconds to complete.
					</p>
				</div>
				
				<div class="midRightColumn">

				</div>
				
				
				<div class="pageSubSection">
					<p> 
						As I joined the track team, I was given the task of designing a racetrack set in an Oasis-like environment with some requirements established by the game designer 
						and lead track designer, such as: 1) the track geometry must be done using a spline tool blueprint developed internally, 2) the track must have a constant established width, 
						3) the track must have parts where it splits up and merges back, and 4) the track must use a given set of features, such as environment hazards 
						(which were later cut due to time constraints) and pickups (which were replaced by energy gates where players get a powerup when crossing these gates).
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I started by looking for visual references to give myself some thematic inspiration for the track design as well as keeping a close communication with the environment team 
						(the sub-team dedicated to build the environment around the tracks) to make sure our shared vision was consistent. I also researched several other racing games such as Outrun, 
						the Mario Kart series, Redout, and MotoGP Ultimate Racing Technology to see what they have done with their track design and gather some common patterns/specs, such as how long 
						does it take to complete a lap, how the turns and curve feel like, how others play these games, and so on.
					</p>
					
					<p>
						I then started sketching out an initial version of the map with a list of features and ideas that I wanted to implement, such as rollercoaster-like flips, 
						going in and out of a central pond in the oasis, landmarks and things that the player will see, pronounced ups and downs, shortcuts, etc. 
					</p>
					
					<a href="images/IRL/FallenCityInitialSketch.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/IRL/FallenCityInitialSketch.png" alt="Fallen City screenshot" width="75%" style="padding:5%; margin:auto; display:block"></a>
					
					
					<p>
						Once I shared my design with the team and had it approved, I started constructing it in Unreal Engine 4. To start off, I did quick iterations to figure out the map’s proportions, 
						get a sense of scale, what felt good to drive on, and what sections of the track needed to be revised before I started committing into it. As I iterated over the design of the 
						track, I always kept in mind the core actions of the game and how these played in the track, such as “how do the turns feel”, “how much does the player accelerate vs decelerate”, 
						“what opportunities do players have to interact with each other”, and more importantly: “Are players having fun.” After subsequent tests and peer reviews, 
						I managed to deliver the final version of this map.

				<h3>Postmortem</h3>
				<h4>What Went Well</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>I was able to deliver everything that I promised to deliver on every sprint.</li>
					<li>I was able to keep crunch time to a minimum through planning and time management.</li>
					<li>I managed to adapt well as I moved between sub-teams inside our studio to assist other teams as needed.</li>
				</ul>

				<h4>What Went Wrong</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Sometimes I felt I didn’t communicate my concerns early enough.</li>
					<li>I feel I could've engage more in team discussions.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h4>What I Learned</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						I learned that even though every member of our team were physically close to each other, using communication software such as 
						Slack with dedicated channels greatly facilitates interdepartmental communication.
					</li>
					
					<li>Having a clear vision of the game from the beginning increases the chance of making a successful game.</li>
					
					<li>
						It is very helpful to have other teammates review my work as early and frequent as possible. 
						It is far cheaper to fix issues at earlier stages of development than later on in development.  
					</li>
				</ul>
