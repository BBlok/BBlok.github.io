			<h2>3D Game Projects</h2>
			
			<p>
				When it comes to designing a game, designing levels for both 2D and 3D games is one of the things that I 
				enjoy doing the most, including the architecture and aesthetics of the levels, placement of objects, lighting, 
				and finally testing how these components synthesize the gaming experience for the player. This page contains
				some of the works that I have done in designing 3D levels for a first-person shooter experience.

			<h3>Unreal Tournament 4 CTF Map: Egocentric Empanadas</h3>

			<div class="midLeftColumn">
		
			
				<p>
					Egocentric Empanadas is a Capture the Flag (CTF) multiplayer map 
					developed for Unreal Tournament 4 where two opposing teams fight 
					against each other to capture the other team’s flag to return it 
					to their base to score points. This is a map designed for 8 players 
					(4 players per team) with a focus on fast-pace gameplay. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					This is an open space arena floating in space with almost no enclosed rooms. 
					Its overall shape is lineal so that the bases are at 
					opposite ends of the map and are directly facing each other.This map 
					also makes extensive use of jump pads with long trajectories for players 
					to quickly fly around the map while dodging enemies and engaging in mid-air combat.
				</p>
					
				<p>	The link below has a packaged version of the map that is ready to play</p>

		<h3>Mods - Classic Doom Singleplayer Level</h3>
		<div class="midLeftColumn">

			<p>
				One of my first experiences in designing levels started with making levels for Doom back in mid 2000s. When I started learning to use 
				the doom builder level editor and started making my own levels, it became one of my favorite hobbies to do at the time, 
				and as I kept progressing in my level design skills and making more maps, I started to learn and get some experience in various aspects about
				level desing, including making interesting and engaging level architecture and aesthetics, lighting, a little bit of 
				cinematography, object/enemy positioning, and trying out several desings to see how these elements come into play and 
				affect the game flow once they are combined.
			</p><br />
			
			<p>
				The video in this section shows one of the levels I designed and made from scratch using Doom Builder. Please note that 
				my work consists solely in making the level itself as well as planning the enemy/object positioning, lighting, and some scripting to
				make the intro of the level. Everything else belongs to their respective owners

			<div class="midLeftColumn">
				<p>
					In this project, I decided to challenge myself to make a level for Killing Floor 2 from scratch using the Killing Floor 2 SDK (which is powered by 
					Unreal Engine). Being my first level made using this SDK and my first project working with static meshes and BSP brushes, I decided to
					start with a relatively simple project and make a level based on the Temple multiplayer level from Goldeneye 007 to apply some of the techniques that
					I have learned so far in Unreal Engine such as UV map/unwrap, material creation, diffuse and normal maps, and level contruction using a modular set
					of 3d models. To make this level, I created a series of modular pieces (static meshes) in 3ds Max and later used them to compose it in a modular way. In order to match the mood of the game , I also decided to give the level a dark/sinister feel by manipulating the lighting in the environment.
